# Phishing_link_detection
Phishing Detection Tool The Phishing Detection Tool is a Python-based solution designed to identify and analyze potenThis lightweight, user-friendly tool leverages various detection techniques to assess the risk of a given URL, providing a quick and reliable way to determine whether a link is safe to access.

**Key Features**
URL Pattern Analysis: Detects suspicious patterns like IP-based domains, excessive subdomains, or URLs containing phishing-related keywords.
Domain Reputation Check: Cross-checks links against known phishing databases (ready for API integrations like Google Safe Browsing or VirusTotal).
Top-Level Domain (TLD) Check: Flags URLs with uncommon or suspicious TLDs (e.g., .xyz, .top).
Shortened URL Detection: Recognizes and warns users about shortened URLs from popular services like bit.ly or tinyurl.com.
Phishing Risk Scoring: Combines multiple detection methods to assign a risk score, categorizing URLs as Safe, Suspicious, or Phishing.

**How It Works**
1. Input a URL for analysis.
2. The tool performs checks for:
3. Suspicious patterns.
4. Known phishing domains.
5. Use of uncommon TLDs or URL shorteners.
Outputs a risk score and classification, helping users decide whether to proceed or avoid the link.

**Technologies Used**
Python: The core programming language for logic implementation.
Regular Expressions (Regex): For URL pattern matching and keyword analysis.
Optional APIs: Placeholder support for integrating domain reputation services.
